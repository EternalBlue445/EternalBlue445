# Hi 👋
I am a developer who thrives on building projects from scratch and solving problems across multiple domains. My technical versatility allows me to work comfortably with backend systems (Django, FastAPI), desktop applications (Qt C++) and AI-powered tools. I test software with extreme inputs to catch edge cases before they become problems. I contribute to open-source projects and focus on writing code that doesnt break when things get tough.
